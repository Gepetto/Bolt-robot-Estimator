## Center of Mass Estimator for Bolt bipedal robot





### What is this Git ?


This Git contains the code of a speed, position, attitude and contact estimator, to be implemented on bipedal robot Bolt.


### What is Bolt ?


Bolt is a 6-DOF robot developed by the Open Dynamic Robot Initiative (ODRI)[https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/biped_6dof_v1/README.md].
