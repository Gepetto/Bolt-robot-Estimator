### Bolt


Bolt is a 6-DOF robot developed by the Open Dynamic Robot Initiative (ODRI)[https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/biped_6dof_v1/README.md].

It is a bipedal variant of Solo-12 quadruped robot.
Its main function is to serve as a developpment platform for reasearch purposes.
